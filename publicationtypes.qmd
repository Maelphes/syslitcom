### systematic review {#sec-sysrev}

A **systematic review** (SR) is a comprehensive review of the best available 
evidence (i.e. all relevant research results) pertaining to a certain topic or 
research question. SRs are usually conducted by research groups over the time of
several months. The purpose of SRs is to inform evidence-based decision making.

SRs are regarded as the gold standard in evidence synthesis due to the strict 
and rigorous methodology that should be followed by the SR project team.

In many cases a so-called **meta-analysis** is also performed, which quantifies
the results of the systematic review. (See @Murad2014, @Nagendrababu2020, @Mulrow1994)
