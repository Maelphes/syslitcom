# Methods {#sec-methods}

## Boolean operators {#sec-boolean}

Databases usually allow a search to be structured using the three basic 
operations of Boolean algebra, which are expressed with the 
**Boolean operators** `AND` (conjunction), `OR` (disjunction) and `NOT` 
(negation). The `AND` operator creates an intersection of sets, `OR` creates a 
union of sets and `NOT` excludes sets (see @fig-boolean).

![Boolean Operators](./fig/boole.svg){#fig-boolean width=80%}

::: {.callout-tip title="Examples"}
- The query `"heart attack" AND diabetes AND obesity` retrieves only records 
featuring all three terms. 
- The query `"cardiac arrest" OR asystole` retrieves records containing at 
least one of the two terms. 
- The query `animals NOT humans` removes all records mentioning humans from the
set `animals`. 
:::

::: {.callout-important title="Caution"}
Using the `NOT` operator can be dangerous, as it excludes records regardless of
any relevant search terms they might contain. The above example excludes also
records with animals if they mention humans.
:::

### Properties {.unnumbered}

The Boolean operators `AND` and `OR` possess similar properties as the 
multiplication and addition. See @tbl-booleanproperties. (@ORegan2012)

::: {#tbl-booleanproperties}
```python
 (a OR b) = (b OR a)                        # <1>
 (a AND b) = (b AND a)                      # <1>
 ----
 (a OR b) OR c = a OR (b OR c)              # <2>
 (a AND b) AND c = a AND (b AND c)          # <2>
 ----
 a AND (b OR c) = (a AND b) OR (a AND c)    # <3>
 a OR (b AND c) = (a OR b) AND (a OR c)     # <3>
 ```

## citation searching {#sec-citationsearching}

Relevant references can be retrieved by analyzing citation relationships between
known relevant articles, called [*seed papers*](#sec-seedpaper) (also known as *core papers*) and 
cited or citing references. This technique is called **citation searching**, 
**citation analysis** or **citation tracking** (@Hirt2024, @Belter2016, 
@Hinde2015).

The [TARCiS Statement](#sec-tarcis) provides a guideline for citation searching.
(@Hirt2024)

Citation searching can be advisable at the very beginning of a systematic 
literature search in order to find additional core papers and to identify 
additional search terms. After finishing the final search it can be used to 
find additional relevant studies that were not retrieved by systematic searching
using search strategies.

Some research questions are hard to search by a conventional 
Boolean approach, for instance due to very ambiguous search terms or very
recent research topics for which no index terms and no established terminology 
exists, yet. In these cases a citation search can be more useful than a Boolean 
search as it relies solely on the citation relationships between known and yet 
unknown publications.

There are different approaches to searching citations: First, in the 
**backward citation searching** method the lists of references cited in the 
seed papers are screened for relevant articles. Second, the analysis of 
publications citing the seed paper as a reference is called 
**forward citation searching**. 
See @fig-citing-cited. 

![backward and forward citation searching](./fig/citing-cited.svg){#fig-citing-cited width=80%}


Third, the identification of relevant literature by counting co-cited or co-citing 
references which connect the seed paper with other papers is called 
**co-citation searching**. In theory, the relevance of these other papers should
increase with an increasing number of connecting publications.

### co-cited citation searching

A seed paper (SP) is connected to other relevant publications (ORP) if both the 
SP and the ORP are cited by the same paper. In this case the SP and the ORP are
**co-cited** by a number of publications. See @fig-cocited.


![co-cited citation searching retrieves publications which share citations with the core paper](./fig/co-citing.svg){#fig-cocited width=80%}


### co-citing citation searching

A similar relationship exists between the SP and ORP if they both 
share a number of mutual references. In this case they are **co-citing** a set 
of common literature. See @fig-cociting.

## critical appraisal {#sec-criticalappraisal}
One of the main steps in evidence-based medicine is the **critical appraisal**
of evidence. Critical appraisal checklists help to assess the methodological 
quality of a studies and to determine the extent to which a study has excluded 
or minimized the possibility of bias in its design, conduct and analysis.

## deduplication {#sec-deduplication}
Whenever multiple databases are searched it is unavoidable that various 
references are retrieved more than once due to the overlapping of contents. 
The removal of duplicate records from a dataset is called **deduplication**. 

Deduplication can be carried out manually using reference management software
or in an automated way using review tools. The methods and tools for 
deduplication differ in their mode of operation and the quality of results 
(@Janka2024, @McKeown2021, @Bramer2016).

An unwelcome practice, which makes deduplication (and concomitantly any
scientific work) more difficult, is repetitive, duplicate or redundant 
publishing (@Ding2020, @Johnson2006, @Kassirer1995).

## filters {#sec-filters}

**Filters** (also *search filters*, *filter strategies* or *hedges*) are 
[search strategies](#sec-searchstrategy) designed to retrieve records for a 
specific concept of the research question.

There are filters for specific patient groups or diseases, outcomes, study types
(for instance to retrieve only randomized controlled trials (RCTs), or filters 
for other aspects of the research question, e.g. adverse effects, diagnostic 
accuracy or patient values. (@Waffenschmidt2020, @SalvadorOlivan2021, @Lee2012, @Golder2006a)

Validated filters are developed, tested and optimized for sensitivity and 
precision by experts. (@Haynes2004, @Glanville2008)

Filter strategies can be implemented in a search strategy just like any concept 
of the research question. @tbl-filterstrategy illustrates a search strategy with
a short qualitative research filter in lines 8 to 11, which is added to the 
overall search in line 12.


::: {#tbl-filterstrategy}
```python
1	hypertension/
2	(hypertension or high blood pressure).ti,ab.
3	1 or 2
4	exp patient attitude/
5	*patient satisfaction/

:::

## field code {#sec-fieldcode}
The [data fields](#sec-datafield) of databases possess short designations called
**field codes**, **field tags** or field labels, which allow to search the fields 
separately as part of a search query or [search strategy](#sec-searchstrategy).

Depending on the [syntax](#sec-syntax) of the database or search interface 
different field codes are available for searching. If no field code is used in
a search query, the search term is usually searched in all fields or a preset 
variety of fields. 

::: {.callout-tip title="Example"}
In PubMed the query `hypnosis[TIAB]` will basically search for records with 
"hypnosis" in the title or abstract. In Ovid the same search would be written 
as `hypnosis.ti,ab.`
:::

See also [PubMed Search field tags](https://pubmed.gov/help/#search-tags) and 
[Ovid Medline Fields](https://ospguides.ovid.com/OSPguides/medline.htm#search).


## focus topic {#sec-focustopic}
**Focus topics** (also called **major topics**) are weighted [index terms](#sec-indexterms). 
If a particular topic is at the heart of a publication, index terms for that topic 
will be assigned as a so-called focus topic. This is often displayed in the
databases by writing an [asterisk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterisk) 
before or after the index term.

::: {.callout-warning title="Risk of confusion"}
The asterisk `*` appears also as a [wildcard character](#sec-wildcard) for 
[truncation](#sec-truncation). The two look the same, but have different 
meanings and uses. Don't let them confound you.
:::

By labeling an index term this way, its significance for the publication is 
visualized. Moreover, searching for the focus topic instead of the index term 
allows for a search to be focused only on the most important papers for a 
particular topic.

:::  {.callout-tip title="Example"}
1. A systematic review on hypertension will most likely feature the focus topic 
`*hypertension`, whereas an artikle about vascular diseases might be indexed 
with `hypertension` as a normal subject heading. Searching for 
`hypertension[majr]` in PubMed or `*hypertension/` in Ovid would yield only the 
first of those two articles. A search for `hypertension[mh]` `hypertension/` 
would find both of them.

2. The article [Apnoeic oxygenation during paediatric tracheal intubation](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38030551/) by 
@Fuchs2024 is indexed with `Intubation, Intratracheal* / adverse effects` and 
`Intubation, Intratracheal* / methods` as major topics, whereas 
`Hypoxia / etiology` was added as a regular MeSH term as it is not the main 
focus of the article.
:::



## frequency operators {#sec-frequencyops}
Records in which a relevant expression occurs multiple times might be more 
relevant than records with fewer instances of the same expression. Therefore 
some search interfaces allow the use of a so-called frequency operator, which 
only retrieves records only if the search term occurs at least the specified 
number of times in the searched data field. 

::: {.callout-tip title="Example"}
Example from Ovid: The query `"pharmacy".ab/freq=5` will retrieve articles, in 
which the term `pharmacy` occurs at least five times within the abstract.
:::


## index terms {#sec-indexterms}

**Index terms**, also called **subject headings** (or sometimes *descriptor*) 
are expressions defined for the purpose of [indexing](#sec-indexing). 
They represent content-related concepts and are organized as a 
 [controlled vocabulary](#sec-thesaurus). By adding index terms 
to a record it becomes retrievable based on its contents. 

Using index terms in a search is an essential part of a
[systematic literature search](#sec-syslitsearch). The index term search can be
focused by employing [subheadings](#sec-subheading) or searching the terms as 
[focus topics](#sec-focustopic).

Index terms should not be confused with free text terms or 
[author keywords](#sec-authorkeywords). 

:::{.callout-tip title="Example"}
The [MeSH term](#sec-thesaurus) for the concept of *heart attack* or 
*cardiovascular stroke* is [`Myocardial infarction`](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/68009203)

The [Emtree term](#sec-thesaurus) (index term in [Embase](#sec-embase)) 
for the same concept is `heart infarction`.
:::



## limits {#sec-limits}
There are various means to restrict the results of a search. One of them are 
so-called **limits** which are filter options provided by the search interface,
which allow the search results to be limited to characteristics such as 
publication type, language or year of publication.

::: {.callout-warning}
1. Database limits are not to be mistaken for validated filter strategies. Limits 
are usually based on certain data fields, whereas validated search filters are 
more complex search strategies. See also @sec-filters.

2. Database limits based on index terms may lead to the unintended exclusion of
non-indexed records.

3. The usage of database limits is not always evident from the search history. 
If it is not possible to display applied limits in the search history, its use
should be reported in the documentation.
:::


## nesting {#sec-nesting}

**Nesting** refers to the use of parentheses `( )` to group search terms within 
a query. The purpose of nesting a search query is to define the order in which 
the search terms and operators processed. The properties of the operators in 
combination with parentheses are displayed in @tbl-booleanproperties.

Without nesting the order in which the elements of a search query are processed 
depends on the rules of the respective search interface. This means that the 
same query might produce very different results in the individual databases.

::: {.callout-tip title="Examples"}
1. Within PubMed all searches are processed [in a left-to-right sequence](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/help/#combining-with-boolean-operators). 

Thus the following PubMed queries yield completely different results:

- `exercise[MH] AND infection[MH] OR heart[MH]`
- `exercise[MH] AND heart[MH] OR infection[MH]`
- `heart[MH] OR infection[MH] AND exercise[MH]`

On the other hand the following nested queries are identical:

- `exercise[MH] AND (infection[MH] OR heart[MH])`
- `exercise[MH] AND (heart[MH] OR infection[MH])`
- `(heart[MH] OR infection[MH]) AND exercise[MH]`

2. Web of Science executes the search in an [order of precedence](https://webofscience.help.clarivate.com/en-us/Content/search-operators.html#Search) of the operators.
:::

## phrases {#sec-phrases}

Most databases can be searched for verbatim expressions, called _phrases_ or 
_literal strings_, by putting search terms in quotation marks `" "`. 

::: {.callout-note title="Effects"} 
The use of phrases usually terminates any automatically applied 
techniques, such as _lemmatization_, _stemming_ or _automated term mapping_ 
(ATM) for those expressions. In this way, the use of phrases usually reduces the 
amount of search results as it makes the search more precise and less sensitive.

Example:

Due to automated term mapping the PubMed query `heart arrest` will be translated
to  
`"heart arrest"[MeSH Terms] OR "heart"[All Fields] AND "arrest"[All Fields] OR "heart arrest"[All Fields]`

However, the query `"heart arrest"` translates to `"heart arrest"[All Fields]`, 
because [phrases are not automatically mapped in PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/help/#searching-for-a-phrase).
:::

::: {.callout-warning title="Phrases and Truncation"}
In some cases the simultaneous use of phrases and truncation is not supported by
the search interface.

Searching for `"hearing aid*"` in the Cochrane Library will prompt an error
message suggesting the use of the `NEXT` operator to work around the problem. 
In other words, the search query should be `hearing NEXT aid*` instead.
:::

::: {.callout-tip title="Required quotation marks"}
Phrases are absolutely necessary when the search string contains a special 
character or anything the search interface would interpret as an operator or 
syntax. Examples for Ovid:

- `"go/no-go".ti,ab.` -- Without the quotation marks the forward slash `/` would
be understood as command to search the expression `go` as an index term.
- `"Sensitivity and Specificity"/` -- `and` is also an operator and must be 
escaped using the quotation marks.
- `"5".ip` -- This search retrieves all records with the number 5 in the 
Issue/Part field. Without the quotation marks, the query would search for the
*contents of line 5* in the field `.ip`. (That procedure is called 
*postqualification* of search sets). 
:::

::: {.callout-warning title="Straight quotes vs. curly quotes"}
There are several types of [quotation marks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotation_mark). 
Search interfaces often only understand so-called _straight quotes_ `" "` (the 
ones that have been used in typewriters). Modern word processors often change 
straight quotes automatically into the [typographically correct](https://practicaltypography.com/straight-and-curly-quotes.html) 
_curly quotes_ `“ ”` (the way they are printed in books), which can cause a 
syntax error, if they are copied into a search query. This is a [known issue in Ovid](https://wkhealth.force.com/ovidsupport/s/article/How-can-I-copy-and-paste-my-search-strategy-from-Word-to-Ovid). 

Options to counter this problem:

1. Deactivation of the responsible autocorrection feature of the word processor.
2. Using a simpler [plain text editor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_editor).
:::

## search strategy {#sec-searchstrategy}
A **search strategy** is a coherent set of search queries designed to retrieve 
references for a particular topic. A search strategy is dependent on the 
[syntax](#sec-syntax) and [index terms](#sec-indexterm) of the searched database. As a consequence, the search strategy needs to be translated for the use in other 
databases.

Search strategies are supposed to be consistent with the predefined eligibility 
criteria of the research project (@Gough2017).

Depending on the purpose and detail of the search, the extent of a search 
strategy might range from a simple search string to numerous lines of search 
terms connected by [Boolean operators](#sec-boolean).

@tbl-searchstrategy-pubmed and @tbl-searchstrategy-ovid show examples for both 
types of search strategies.

::: {#tbl-searchstrategy-pubmed}
```default
"analgesics"[MH] OR "analgesic*"[TIAB] OR "analgesic*"[PA] OR "anodynes"[TIAB] 
OR "antinociceptive*"[TIAB]) AND "pain management"[MAJR]
```

3 *pain management/

```
Multi-line search strategy for Ovid MEDLINE
:::

## subheading {#sec-subheading}
Publications in [bibliographic databases](#sec-bibdb) are often indexed using
[index terms](#sec-indexterm). In cases where the index term does not sufficiently describe the 
content of the article, so-called **subheadings** or **qualifiers** can be 
applied to the index term to specify certain aspects.

:::{.callout-tip title="Example"}
The PubMed search query `Respiratory Tract Infections/drug therapy[MeSH]` 
(or short `Respiratory Tract Infections/dt[mh]`) retrieves references focusing 
on the drug therapy of respiratory tract infections.
:::

Typical subheadings are ´adverse effects´´, ´complications´, ´diagnosis´, 
´drug therapy´, ´economics´, ´epidemiology´, ´history´, ´methods´, ´pathology´,
´pharmacology´, ´psychology´, ´standards´, ´therapeutic use´, ´toxicology´.

Sometimes it may be required to retrieve all publications featuring a 
certain subheading regardless of the index terms, for instance when one is 
interested in reports of adverse effects. In order to do that the 
subheading can be searched alone as a so-called **floating subheading**, for 
example `adverse effects[sh]` in PubMed or `ae.fs` in Ovid MEDLINE.

For more information about subheadings in PubMed see 
<https://pubmed.gov/help/#mesh-subheadings> or 
<https://nlm.nih.gov/mesh/qualifiers_scopenotes.html>.


## systematic literature searching {#sec-syslitsearch}

Conducting a **systematic literature search** (also called **systematic 
search**) means to search multiple databases for references to relevant 
articles and studies in a structured, planned and iterative manner. 
A systematic search is well-documented, transparent and (to a certain degree) 
reproducible. 

::: {.callout-tip title="Information specialists and librarians"}
Systematic searches are best conducted or at least accompanied by information 
specialists or librarians. For more on this topic, see @Spencer2018, 
@Metzendorf2016, @Foster2015, @Koffel2015, @Rethlefsen2015, @Schellinger2021, 
@Meert2016.
:::

The purpose of a systematic literature search is to find relevant literature in 
the desired degree of completeness. For a systematic review the search should 
be very [sensitive](#sec-sensitivity) as to find all the relevant evidence. 
In contrast, the literature search as part of a rapid review or narrative 
review may still be done systematically, but can be designed in a more [precise](#sec-precision) 
manner, since in those cases it may be acceptable to miss some relevant 
articles. (See @#sec-class-metrics about sensitivity and precision).

There are various guidelines which can be followed to conduct systematic 
searches, such as the *Cochrane Handbook* (@cochranehandbook6.3) or the 
*JBI Manual* (@JBIManual2020). Depending on the desired [type of review](#sec-review) 
(e.g. systematic, scoping, narrative, ..., see 
@Munn2018, @Munn2018 or @Pearson2015)

::: {.callout-note title="important steps of a systematic search"}
1. definition of a **research question**
2. selection of **databases**
3. compilation of **search terms**
4. setup of an **initial search**
5. iterative **refinement** of the search strategy
6. **peer review** of the search strategy
7. **translation** to other databases
8. **final search** and export of results
9. **documentation** of the search
:::

Various methods are applied in the design of search strategies. Keywords and 
index terms are connected using *operators*. The search queries are structured 
by *nesting*. The precision and sensitivity of the search is adjusted using 
*truncation*, by the choice of *search fields* or the use of *term explosion*.  

A systematic search is best peer-reviewed by colleagues (e.g. by information 
specialists, other researchers, or fellow students), following the PRESS 
guideline by @McGowan2016.  

Ideally, the systematic search is documented according the PRISMA-S extension 
by @Rethlefsen2021.  


## term explosion {#sec-termexplosion}
Index terms in databases are usually hierarchically organized, starting with 
very broad terms in the top categories to very specific terms further down the 
branches of the hierarchy. 

When searching using an index term, it is often possible to include all 
subordinate index terms in the search. This simultaneous search option is called 
*term explosion*.

:::{.callout-warning title="Warning"}
Keep in mind that depending on the search interface or database, the term 
explosion might be active by default, as it is the case in [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/help/#mh).
This can be avoided by using the field codes `[mh:noexp]` or `[majr:noexp]` 
instead of `[mh]` or `[majr]`.
:::

::: {.callout-tip title="Examples"}
- The PubMed search query `Psychotherapy[MH]` automatically retrieves records 
featuring the MeSH term `psychotherapy` as well as `aromatherapy`, 
`behaviour therapy`, `crisis intervention`, `hypnosis`, or `logotherapy`, 
because in PubMed the term explosion is active by default. However, 
the query `Psychotherapy[MH:NoExp]` retrieves only records indexed with 
`psychotherapy`.  

- In Ovid MEDLINE, the search for `psychotherapy/` looks only for references 
indexed with `psychotherapy`, whereas the query `exp psychotherapy/` searches 
the exploded term, i.e. it uses the subordinate index terms such as 
`aromatherapy`, `crisis intervention`, etc. in the search, too.
:::

## truncation {#sec-truncation}
In general, *to truncate* means to reduce something down to its trunk, to 
shorten something, to cut something off.

In literature searching **truncation** is a technique that allows to search 
several variations of a term at once by searching with a reduced (truncated) 
version of the search term. A term is truncated by replacing one or more 
characters with a so-called [*wildcard character*](#sec-wildcard), 
such as `*`, `$`, `?`, `#`.

The most common form of truncation is the unlimited truncation (usually using 
the asterisk `*` or the dollar sign `$`) at the end of the search term. 
In some databases it is possible to limit the truncation to a fixed number of 
characters or to replace just one character. The kinds of truncation that are 
available depend on the [syntax](#sec-syntax) of the database or search interface. 

::: {#tbl-truncations}
| query       | covered search terms                               |

: Truncation examples in Ovid {.hover}
:::

Usually only free text terms are truncated. While it might be possible 
to truncate index terms, it is not very practical; truncated index terms are 
rarely used meaningfully, for instance in valiated [search filters](#sec-filters),
such as the search term `diagnostic*[MeSH:noexp]` in the 
[diagnosis filter](https://hiruweb.mcmaster.ca/hkr/hedges/medline/#diagnosis_embase) 
by @Kastner2009.
