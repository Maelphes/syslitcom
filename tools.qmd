## FINER
FINER is an acronym for the five criteria **feasible**, **interesting**, **novel**, **ethical** and **relevant** which can be used as guidance when formulating a good clinical research question. See @tbl-finer. (@Cummings2013)


::: {#tbl-finer}
```{=latex}
\begin{table*}[!ht]
  \begin{tabular}{l p{7.8cm}}
    \toprule
    \textbf{Criterion} & \textbf{Meaning}\\
    \midrule
feasible & The research question should not exceed the available resources, i.e.\ participants, expertise, time and money). \\
interesting & The research question should in itself be interesting, not only to the researcher, but also to a broader public. \\
novel & The gain of knowledge and new information should be at the heart of the question. Research usually does not only reiterate already established data unless it is designed as a confirmatory study. \\
ethical & Proper research has to be ethical and must not bear unacceptable risks for its participants. \\
relevant & The expected impact of the research on scientific knowledge and clinical processes can be a good measurement parameter for the relevance. \\
		\bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
\end{table*}

## Reference Management software
Bibliographic records and similar sets of data such as clinical study metadata 
can be stored and managed using reference management programs (also called 
citation management software). 

These programs are usually able to perform tasks with the records, such as
- import and export of various formats (e.g. RIS, NBIB, BIB, TXT, CSV, XML)
- creation, editing and updating
- deduplication
- retrieval of full-texts
- output of citations in various styles
