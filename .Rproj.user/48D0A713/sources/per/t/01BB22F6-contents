## Boolean operators {#sec-boolean}

Databases usually allow a search to be structured using the three basic 
operations of Boolean algebra, which are expressed with the 
**Boolean operators** `AND` (conjunction), `OR` (disjunction) and `NOT` 
(negation). The `AND` operator creates an intersection of sets, `OR` creates a 
union of sets and `NOT` excludes sets (see @fig-boolean).

::: {.callout-tip appearance="simple"}
## Examples
- The query `"heart attack" AND diabetes AND obesity` retrieves only records 
featuring all three terms. 
- The query `"cardiac arrest" OR asystole` retrieves records containing at 
least one of the two terms. 
- The query `animals NOT humans` removes all records mentioning humans from the
set `animals`.

::: {.callout-important appearance="simple"}
## Caution
Using the `NOT` operator can be dangerous, as it excludes records regardless of
any relevant search terms they might contain. The above example excludes also
records with animals if they mention humans.

### Properties {.unnumbered}

The Boolean operators `AND` and `OR` possess similar properties as the 
multiplication and addition. See @tbl-2. (@ORegan2012)

```python
 (a OR b) = (b OR a)                        # <1>
 (a AND b) = (b AND a)                      # <1>
 ----
 (a OR b) OR c = a OR (b OR c)              # <2>
 (a AND b) AND c = a AND (b AND c)          # <2>
 ----
 a AND (b OR c) = (a AND b) OR (a AND c)    # <3>
 a OR (b AND c) = (a OR b) AND (a OR c)     # <3>
```

## citation analysis

Relevant references can be retrieved by analyzing citation relationships between
known relevant articles (*core papers*) and cited or citing references. This 
technique is called **citation analysis** or **citation tracking** (@Hirt2021, 
@Belter2016, @Hinde2015.

Citation analysis can be advisable at the very beginning of a systematic 
literature search in order to find additional core papers and to identify 
additional search terms. After finishing the final search it can be used to 
find additional relevant studies that were not retrieved by systematic searching
using search strategies.

There are different approaches to tracking citations: First, in the **backward 
citation tracking** method the lists of references cited in the core papers are 
screened for relevant articles. Second, the analysis of publications citing the 
core paper as reference is called **forward citation tracking**. 
See @fig-citing-cited.

Third, the identification of relevant literature by counting co-cited or co-citing 
references is called **co-citation tracking**, see @fig-cociting and @fig-cocited.
