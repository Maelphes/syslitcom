# Welcome {#sec-about .unnumbered}

This is a compendium for the field of systematic literature searching. It 
contains technical terms, methods and background information related to the 
retrieval of references from literature databases. 

The main idea is to inform anyone who undertakes a systematic literature search
about relevant terms of the trade.

In @sec-databases you will learn about all kinds of data sources and search 
interfaces as well as their syntax.

Technical terms of all sorts are explained in @sec-technicalterms.

@sec-tools tells you about various tools and useful concepts for creating
your search for evidence.
