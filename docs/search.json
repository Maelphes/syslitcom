    "text": "2.6 bias\nBias is a systematic deviation between results and facts that may lead to under- or over-estimation of intervention effects. As a result bias might lead to conclusions which do not accurately represent the truth. There are various types and sources for bias, as well as methods to avoid some forms of bias, such as randomization or blinding of participants in clinical trials.\nSystematic literature searching is a means to reduce bias. Systematic reviews strive to minimise these deviations by assessing the risk of bias in results of included studies. (Braun et al. (2021), Boutron et al. (2022), Gough, Oliver, and Thomas (2017))\n\n2.6.1 selection bias\nSystematic differences between comparison groups lead to a deviation from the true effect of an intervention. This so-called selection bias can be prevented by measures such as the sufficient randomization and concealment of allocation of trial participants to different study arms.(Gough, Oliver, and Thomas (2017), Odgaard‐Jensen et al. (2011))\n\n\n2.6.2 publication bias\nResults perceived as “positive” are more likely to be published than those results which are perceived as “negative”, which gives the positive results more weight. (Gough, Oliver, and Thomas (2017))\n\n\n2.6.3 language of publication bias\nIn systematic literature searches it is often tempting to restrict the search to languages which are easily understood by the screeners and researchers. Not only will this practive keep the number of records at a more manageable level, it also makes the translation of foreign publications unnecessary. However, this so-called language of publication bias can have a significant impact on the quality of the review. (Gough, Oliver, and Thomas (2017), Morrison et al. (2012), Moher et al.

The purpose of nesting a search query is to define the order in which the search terms and operators processed. The properties of the operators in combination with parentheses are displayed in Table 4.1.\nWithout nesting the order in which the elements of a search query are processed depends on the rules of the respective search interface. This means that the same query might produce very different results in the individual databases.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples\n\n\n\n\nWithin PubMed all searches are processed in a left-to-right sequence.\n\nThus the following PubMed queries yield completely different results:\n\nexercise[MH] AND infection[MH] OR heart[MH]\nexercise[MH] AND heart[MH] OR infection[MH]\nheart[MH] OR infection[MH] AND exercise[MH]\n\nOn the other hand the following nested queries are identical:\n\nexercise[MH] AND (infection[MH] OR heart[MH])\nexercise[MH] AND (heart[MH] OR infection[MH])\n(heart[MH] OR infection[MH]) AND exercise[MH]\n\n\nWeb of Science executes the search in an order of precedence of the operators.",

    "text": "4.9 Phrases\nMost databases can be searched for verbatim expressions, called phrases or literal strings, by putting search terms in quotation marks \" \".\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEffects\n\n\n\nThe use of phrases usually terminates any automatically applied techniques, such as lemmatization, stemming or automated term mapping (ATM) for those expressions. In this way, the use of phrases usually reduces the amount of search results as it makes the search more precise and less sensitive.\nExample:\nDue to automated term mapping the PubMed query heart arrest will be translated to\n\"heart arrest\"[MeSH Terms] OR \"heart\"[All Fields] AND \"arrest\"[All Fields] OR \"heart arrest\"[All Fields]\nHowever, the query \"heart arrest\" translates to \"heart arrest\"[All Fields], because phrases are not automatically mapped in PubMed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhrases and Truncation\n\n\n\nIn some cases the simultaneous use of phrases and truncation is not supported by the search interface.\nSearching for \"hearing aid*\" in the Cochrane Library will prompt an error message suggesting the use of the NEXT operator to work around the problem. In other words, the search query should be hearing NEXT aid* instead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRequired quotation marks\n\n\n\nPhrases are absolutely necessary when the search string contains a special character or anything the search interface would interpret as an operator or syntax. Examples for Ovid:\n\n\"go/no-go\".ti,ab. – Without the quotation marks the forward slash / would be understood as command to search the expression go as an index term.\n\"Sensitivity and Specificity\"/ – and is also an operator and must be escaped using the quotation marks.\n\"5\".ip – This search retrieves all records with the number 5 in the Issue/Part field. Without the quotation marks, the query would search for the contents of line 5 in the field .ip. (That procedure is called postqualification of search sets).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStraight quotes vs. curly quotes\n\n\n\nThere are several types of quotation marks. Search interfaces often only understand so-called straight quotes \" \" (the ones that have been used in typewriters). Modern word processors often change straight quotes automatically into the typographically correct curly quotes “ ” (the way they are printed in books), which can cause a syntax error, if they are copied into a search query. This is a known issue in Ovid.\nOptions to counter this problem:\n\nDeactivation of the responsible autocorrection feature of the word processor.\nUsing a simpler plain text editor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBelter, Christopher W. 2016. “Citation Analysis as a Literature Search Method for Systematic Reviews.” J Assn Inf Sci Tec 67 (11): 2766–77. https://doi.org/10.1002/asi.23605.\n\n\nFuchs, Alexander, Gabriela Koepp, Markus Huber, Jonas Aebli, Arash Afshari, Rachele Bonfiglio, Robert Greif, et al. 2024. “Apnoeic Oxygenation During Paediatric Tracheal Intubation: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.” Brit J Anaesth 132 (February): 392–406. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bja.2023.10.039.\n\n\nGlanville, Julie, Sue Bayliss, Andrew Booth, Yenal Dundar, Hasina Fernandes, Nigel David Fleeman, Louise Foster, et al. 2008. “So Many Filters, so Little Time: The Development of a Search Filter Appraisal Checklist.” J Med Libr Assoc 96 (18974813): 356–61. https://doi.org/10.3163/1536-5050.96.4.011.\n\n\nGolder, Su, Heather M.
