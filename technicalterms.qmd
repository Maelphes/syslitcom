# Technical terms {#sec-technicalterms}

## abstract {#sec-abstract}
An abstract is the short summary at the beginning of scientific publications, 
e.g. journal articles, theses or conference papers. The abstract is among the 
most important parts of a publication as it is usually the only part of the 
text which is freely available and can be retrieved from bibliographic 
databases. Title and abstract are the key elements of a textword search. 
(@Cals2013, @Pitkin1998)


## ambiguity {#sec-ambiguity}
A term or statement which has more than one possible meaning or definition is 
ambiguous. Ambiguity proves to be an obstacle in creating search strategies, 
because any free text search with ambiguous terms will inevitably retrieve 
records for all meanings of the term regardless of the context. In this case, it
is an option to render such terms more specific by using phrases or proximity 
operators.

::: {.callout-tip title="Examples"}
1. `apothecary` might refer to the occuopation of pharmacist or the community 
pharmacy as a location or institution. 
2. The term `pharmacy` may refer to the pharmaceutical sciences, the manufacture
of drugs or the pharmacy as a retail shop.
3. In anatomy, a `styloid process` is a pointed outgrowth from a bone. However, 
there are serveral of these in the human body, for instance in the temporal
bone, the radius bone, the ulna bone or the metacarpal bones.

## appendix {#sec-appendix}
An appendix provides additional content to a publication and is often called
_supplementary material_ or _supplementary information_. Usually any content
which goes beyond the constraints of the publication is provided 
there. Examples are the full search strategies of systematic literature 
searches, detailed descriptions of methods or measurements. 

It is also possible to publish such supplementary information or research data
independently in online repositories.

## author keyword {#sec-authorkeywords}
Publishers often require the authors of a publication to provide keywords 
describing the content of the publication. These keywords don't necessarily 
correspond to controlled vocabulary (i.e. index terms, which are assigned to the 
records by the database) and should not be confused with them. (@Neveol2010)

Author keywords are often used as part of the free text search.

::: {.callout-tip title="Examples"}
Within PubMed the field codes `[OT]` or `[Other Term]` can be used for searching
the author keywords. This field is automatically searched when `[TIAB] `(or 
`[Title/Abstract]`) or `[TW]` (or `[Text Word]`) are used.

In Ovid MEDLINE the corresponding field codes `.kw` or `.kf` can be used for 
searching the author keywords.

## bias {#sec-bias}
Bias is a systematic deviation between results and facts that may lead to under-
or over-estimation of intervention effects. As a result bias might lead to 
conclusions which do not accurately represent the truth. There are various types
and sources for bias, as well as methods to avoid some forms of bias, such as 
randomization or blinding of participants in clinical trials. 

Systematic literature searching is a means to reduce bias. Systematic reviews 
strive to minimise these deviations by assessing the risk of bias in results of 
included studies. (@Braun2021, @Boutron2022, @Gough2017)

### selection bias
Systematic differences between comparison groups lead to a deviation from the
true effect of an intervention. This so-called selection bias can be prevented 
by measures such as the sufficient randomization and concealment of allocation
of trial participants to different study arms.(@Gough2017, @OdgaardJensen2011)

### publication bias
Results perceived as "positive" are more likely to be published than those 
results which are perceived as "negative", which gives the positive results more
weight. (@Gough2017)

### language of publication bias
In systematic literature searches it is often tempting to restrict the search 
to languages which are easily understood by the screeners and researchers. 
Not only will this practive keep the number of records at a more manageable 
level, it also makes the translation of foreign publications unnecessary. 
However, this so-called language of publication bias can have a significant 
impact on the quality of the review. (@Gough2017, @Morrison2012, @Moher2003)


## classification metrics {#sec-class-metrics}

In information retrieval the performance of a systematic search, a search
strategy or a search filter is described by certain metrics for binary 
classification tasks, such as **accuracy**, **precision**, **sensitivity** 
and **specificity**.

A classifier (the search) makes a prediction about the condition of a record 
(by retrieving or not retrieving the record). The classification (the search 
result) is evaluated by comparing the prediction with the actual condition (the 
relevance of the records).

In other words: The literature search is supposed to retrieve mostly relevant 
references and ignore non-relevant ones. A retrieved relevant record equals a
true positive (*tp*), whereas a retrieved non-relevant record equals a false 
positive (*fp*). See @tbl-truth for reference.

::: {#tbl-truth}
|   **record**    | relevant | irrelevant |
|:---------------:|:--------:|:----------:|
|    retrieved    |   _tp_   |    _fp_    |
|  not retrieved  |   _fn_   |    _tn_    |
: Truth table {.striped}
:::


### accuracy {#sec-accuracy} 
**Accuracy**, also called **fraction correct (FC)**, is a statistical measure of
how well a binary classifier correctly ("true") identifies a condition 
("positive or negative"). It is defined as the ratio of all true 
classifications (true positives and true negatives) to the total number of
classifications. (@Haynes2004,  @Lefebvre2017, @Fawcett2006)

It can be calculated according to the following equation:
$$
\text{accuracy} = \tfrac{tp + tn}{tp + fp + fn + tn}
$$


### precision {#sec-precision}
**Precision**, also called **positive predictive value (PPV)**, is a performance 
metric for the retrieval of information. It is the fraction of all relevant 
records among all retrieved records, which can be written as:

$$
\text{precision} = \tfrac{tp}{tp + fp}
$$

A high-precision search tries to retrieve as few non-relevant records as 
possible, usually missing out on relevant records.


### sensitivity {#sec-sensitivity}

**Sensitivity**, also called **true positive rate (TPR)**, **recall** or 
**hit rate**, is a performance metric for the retrieval of informaton, similar 
to the *precision*. It equals the probability with which relevant records are 
correctly identified. (See @Haynes2004, @Lefebvre2017).

It is the ratio of all relevant retrieved records and the total of all relevant 
records:
$$
\text{sensitivity} = \tfrac{tp}{tp + fn}
$$
The idea of a sensitive search is to retrieve as many relevant records as 
possible, which results in retrieving more non-relevant records in the process.


## eligibility criteria {#sec-eligibilitycriteria}
A very important step at the beginning of any review project is the definition
of certain **eligibility criteria** on the basis of the research question. 
There are two types of criteria: 

**Inclusion criteria** must be met by studies in order for
them to be included in the review. In contrast, if a study meets one or more 
of the **exclusion criteria**, it will be excluded from the review.
See also @McKenzie2022, @Gough2017.

::: {.callout-tip title="Example: systematic review about chronic non-cancer pain"}
- Inclusion criteria:
  - adults (18 years or older)
  - patients with chronic non-cancer pain
  - randomized controlled trials
- Exclusion criteria: 
  - acute pain, post-surgical pain 
  - chronic cancer pain
  - pregnancy
:::

## orphan line {#sec-orphanline}

All parts of a [search strategy](#sec-searchstrategy) are supposed to contribute 
to the overall result of the database search. In case a search query within a
search strategy is not connected (using operators) to the rest of the search 
strategy, it is called an **orphan line**.

::: {#tbl-orphanline}
```python
1	hypertension/
2	(hypertension or high blood pressure).ti,ab.
3	*patient attitude/
4	*patient satisfaction/
5	(choice\$ or empower\$).ti.
6	1 or 2
7	3 or 4
8	6 and 7
```
Line 5 is an orphan line.
:::


## PMID and PMCID {#sec-pmid-pmcid}
The PubMed ID (PMID) and the PubMed Central ID (PMCID) are unique identifiers
assigned to the records within the databases [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) 
and [PubMed Central](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/). They are similar to the
digital object identifier (DOI).

PMIDs are unique integer values, e.g. [32256971](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32256971/), 
PMCIDs are composed of the prefix **PMC** followed by a series of numbers, e.g. [PMC7106990](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7106990/).

PubMed records can easily be found simply by entering their [PMIDs as search terms](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=31541534+28475312+21995656+33223580+29327483+35602613+29905334+37465961+35472729+37983749) into the PubMed search.

::: {.callout-tip title="Conversion tool"}
The [National Library of Medicine](https://www.nlm.nih.gov) provides a 
[tool](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/tools/idconv/) for the conversion of the
PMID, PMCID and DOI into one another. This tool only works for records which are
both part of PubMed and PubMed Central.
:::

## Syntax {#sec-syntax}
Similar to programming, the **syntax** is the set of rules that applies 
for setting up search queries and building search strategies in databases. 
It defines the operators, field codes and special characters (such as wildcard 
symbols, parentheses, slashes, quotation marks, etc.) that are available 
within a particular search interface.

As a consequence, search strategies cannot be used freely in every database. 
They have to be translated due to different syntax and due to different 
index terms. (See @Clark2020, @Glanville2019, @Wanner2019, @Damarell2013).
