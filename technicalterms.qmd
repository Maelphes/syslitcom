# Technical terms {#sec-technicalterms}

## abstract {#sec-abstract}
An abstract is the short summary at the beginning of scientific publications, 
e.g. journal articles, theses or conference papers. The abstract is among the 
most important parts of a publication as it is usually the only part of the 
text which is freely available and can be retrieved from bibliographic 
databases. Title and abstract are the key elements of a textword search. 
(@Cals2013, @Pitkin1998)


## accuracy {#sec-accuraccy}

Accuracy (auch Treffergenauigkeit, Vertrauenswahrscheinlichkeit) ist ein 
statistisches G체temass und gibt an, welcher Anteil aller Datens채tze 
korrekterweise *true* gefunden bzw. nicht gefunden wurde. Sie wird als Quotient 
aus der Summe von gefundenen relevanten (*true positives*) und nicht gefundenen 
irrelevanten Datens채tzen (*true negatives*) und der Gesamtheit aller Datens채tze 
angegeben. (@Haynes2004,  @Lefebvre2017, @Fawcett2006)

In der nachfolgenden Tabelle @tbl-truth entspricht dies 
$\tfrac{tp + tn}{tp + fp + fn + tn}$.

Siehe auch precision, sensitivity, specificity.

::: {#tbl-truth}
| **record** | relevant | irrelevant |
|:----------:|:--------:|:----------:|
|    found   |   _tp_   |    _fp_    |
|  not found |   _fn_   |    _tn_    |

## ambiguity {#sec-ambiguity}
A term or statement which has more than one possible meaning or definition is 
ambiguous. Ambiguity proves to be an obstacle in creating search strategies, 
because any free text search with ambiguous terms will inevitably retrieve 
records for all meanings of the term regardless of the context. In this case, it
is an option to render such terms more specific by using phrases or proximity 
operators.

::: {.callout-tip title="Examples"}
1. `apothecary` might refer to the occuopation of pharmacist or the community 
pharmacy as a location or institution. 
2. The term `pharmacy` may refer to the pharmaceutical sciences, the manufacture
of drugs or the pharmacy as a retail shop.
3. In anatomy, a `styloid process` is a pointed outgrowth from a bone. However, 
there are serveral of these in the human body, for instance in the temporal
bone, the radius bone, the ulna bone or the metacarpal bones.

## appendix {#sec-appendix}
An appendix provides additional content to a publication and is often called
_supplementary material_ or _supplementary information_. Full search strategies
are often published within the appendix of a publication.

## author keyword {#sec-authorkeywords}
Publishers often require the authors of a publication to provide keywords 
describing the content of the publication. These keywords don't necessarily 
correspond to controlled vocabulary (index terms), which are assigned to the 
records by the database and should not be confused with them. (@Neveol2010)
The data field for author keywords is often used as part of the free text 
search.

::: {.callout-tip title="Examples"}
Within PubMed the field codes `[OT]` or `[Other Term]` can be used for searching
the author keywords. This field is automatically searched when `[TIAB] `(or 
`[Title/Abstract]`) or `[TW]` (or `[Text Word]`) are used. 
In Ovid MEDLINE the corresponding field codes `.kw` or `.kf` can be used for 
searching the author keywords.

## bias
Bias is a systematic deviation between results and facts that may lead to under-
or over-estimation of intervention effects. As a result bias might lead to 
conclusions which do not accurately represent the truth. There are various types
and sources for bias, as well as methods to avoid some forms of bias, such as 
randomization or blinding of participants in clinical trials. 

Systematic literature searching is a means to reduce bias. Systematic reviews 
strive to minimise these deviations by assessing the risk of bias in results of 
included studies. (@Braun2021, @Boutron2022, @Gough2017)

### selection bias
Systematic differences between comparison groups lead to a deviation from the
true effect of an intervention. This so-called selection bias can be prevented 
by measures such as the sufficient randomization and concealment of allocation
of trial participants to different study arms.(@Gough2017, @OdgaardJensen2011)

### publication bias
Results perceived as "positive" are more likely to be published than those 
results which are perceived as "negative", which gives the positive results more
weight. (@Gough2017)

### language of publication bias
In systematic literature searches it is often tempting to restrict the search 
to languages which are easily understood by the screeners and researchers. 
Not only will this practive keep the number of records at a more manageable 
level, it also makes the translation of foreign publications unnecessary. 
However, this so-called language of publication bias can have a significant 
impact on the quality of the review. (@Gough2017, @Morrison2012, @Moher2003)
